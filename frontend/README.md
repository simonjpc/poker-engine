# Frontend

This folder contains the frontend implementation for the poker engine. The frontend is a React-based web application that provides a user interface for interacting with the backend.

## Description

The frontend allows users to input poker game data, such as hole cards, community cards, and betting decisions, and displays the recommendations and game evaluations provided by the backend.

### Key Features:
- User-friendly interface for inputting poker game data.
- Displays recommendations and game evaluations from the backend.
- Built with React and styled for responsiveness.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Frontend

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes to the code.

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `build` folder.

### Testing

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## File Structure

- **`public/`**: Contains static assets like `index.html`, icons, and the manifest file.
- **`src/`**: Contains the React application source code.
  - **`api.js`**: Handles API calls to the backend for fetching game recommendations and submitting player actions.
  - **`App.js`**: Main application component that manages the overall layout and routing of the application.
  - **`App.css`**: Styles for the main application component, including global layout and theme.
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point for the React application, responsible for rendering the `App` component into the DOM.
  - **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components:
    - **`HoleCardSelector.js`**: Component for selecting and inputting hole cards for a player.
    - **`FlopCardSelector.js`**: Component for selecting and inputting flop cards during the game.
    - **`Player.js`**: Represents a player at the table, including their actions, status, and cards.
    - **`Table.js`**: Represents the poker table layout, including player positions and game state.

## Notes

- Ensure the backend is running before interacting with the frontend.
- The frontend communicates with the backend via API endpoints. Update the API base URL in [`api.js`](src/api.js) if necessary.
